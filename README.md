# Create++
The most full of content create oriented modpack available. With added countless create addons, optimization mods and other QoL mods it is by far the best modpack that focuses on factory-game like gameplay using the widely known create mod.

Adds almost no changes to the vanilla gameplay so there is no need to re-learn how the game worked

1. When using an Nvidia GPU with shaders there will be considerable frame drops as shaders disable the mod that adds mesh rendering for the Nvidia cards (Nvidium)
2. The modpack might lack some addons due to how many of them keep appearing but i will try to keep it up to date
3. As of right now it does not use craft tweaker or KubeJS to link all the addons together so they can be used independtly but that might change
